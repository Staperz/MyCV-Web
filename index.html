                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <p>I'm Matthew, a 21-year-old Software Engineering student at Solent University. I’m passionate about pursuing a career in website and UI development. Currently, I’m in my first year, but I’m eager to kickstart my career with a placement at your company. Your company stands out to me because of its focus within the industry I want to excel in. A placement here would allow me to gain valuable experience, and grow as a front-end developer. I’m looking for a paid placement from June 2025 until the end of August 2025, and also a 1 year placement/internship from June 2026 to September 2027.</p>

                <h2>Why Me?</h2>
                <p>You should hire me because I’m driven and resilient. I set goals and work hard to achieve them, no matter what the challenges is that I face. I learned this lesson the hard way, because in 2021, I enrolled at Keele University without a clear sense of purpose with no drive or direction. After a year, I left because I felt lost and unmotivated and as if I had made a mistake. Taking time off to work helped me realize that I wanted more from life, and I rediscovered my passion for software development. This second attempt at university isn’t just a do-over, it’s my commitment to a future in software development. I made this because I’m focused, determined, and ready to succeed. I don’t shy away from responsibility or hard work. I take ownership of every situation and work to make things right. That’s the kind of mindset I’ll bring to your team.</p>

                <h2>Why do I want a placement?</h2>
                <p>
                    I have noticed while at university a lot of people have had the discussion about placement years and if they are worth it. A lot of people have said they are a waste of time and delaying my degree by a year; however, I feel different about it. I feel that a placement year can be the most important year, the year that you take what you have learnt and apply it in a real-life situation, and the opportunity to learn, work, and have multiple mentors around you within the industry you want to be in. I'm very much looking forward to this year as I know it will be the year I have the most growth in my software development career.
